# Define Coding Standards

## Background

At the start of a new technology addition, it is important that we define coding
standards, standardize on ticket naming conventions, merging strategy, and
obtain a general consensus and understanding on how the project will be run and
the rules of engagement in order to ensure consistency and smooth flow through
development.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Define coding standards and establish those for the team
- [ ] Determine ticket naming conventions and communicate those to the team
- [ ] Decide on merging strategy that will be employed during the course of
      development
- [ ] Communicate these standards and conventions to the development team
