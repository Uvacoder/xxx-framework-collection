# Add framework in Netlify config

## Background

Each framework.dev site is deployed from the same codebase using Netlify. In
this ticket, we are adding this new framework to be added to the Netlify config
so that it gets deployed correctly. Once a new framework site has been approved
to work on, you'll also need to ensure the framework is added to the
build-ignore.js file. This file helps make sure a new build on Netlify only
happens when there are changes that directly affect the framework site. You'll
need to add a case for the new framework to the switch statement. For ease of
review, your framework should be added as the last case statement before the
default.

    case "<framework>":
    console.log("<framework> site match found, checking diff for changes");
    gitDiff = `git diff main ${COMMIT} ./packages/site/src/data/<framework>/
    ./packages/site/src/components/ ./packages/site/src/layouts/ ./packages/site/src/pages/`;
    break;

Then, in your PR for adding the framework site, please make sure to ask a
contributor for assistance with adding the site to Netlify so it can be launched
when it's ready.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Add the new framework on Netlify
- [ ] Add the "Built with Netlify" badge to the new site
- [ ] Test the created PR to make sure that the deployment works as expected

## NOTE:

- You may require someone with AWS access to create the project for you.
