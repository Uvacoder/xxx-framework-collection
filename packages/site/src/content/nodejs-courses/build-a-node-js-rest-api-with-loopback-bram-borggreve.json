	"description": "In this course the developer will learn how to create a LoopBack API and build it out to an API that can be used as a backend for apps. We will start by creating a basic LoopBack API project and gradually enhance it to a production ready API. The API we create defines a few models to persist the data and has custom functionality, validation and hooks added to those models.",
