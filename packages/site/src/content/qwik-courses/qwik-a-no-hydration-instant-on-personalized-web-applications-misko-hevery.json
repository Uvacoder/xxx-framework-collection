	"description": "Qwik is a new breed of frameworks with a goal of instant-on interactivity for your site even on low-power slow-network devices. Qwik is a resumable framework that starts its execution on the server and seamlessly transitions to executing on the client in a very lazy and incremental way. The seamless transition from server to the client provides an instant on-user experience which leads to lower bounce rates, more conversions, and higher sales.",
