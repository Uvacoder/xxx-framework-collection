Ideal for web developers and software engineers who understand how JavaScript, CSS, and HTML work in the browser, this updated edition provides best practices and patterns for writing modern React code. No prior knowledge of React or functional JavaScript is necessary. With their learning road map, authors Alex Banks and Eve Porcello show you how to create UIs that can deftly display changes without page reloads on large-scale, data-driven websites. You’ll also discover how to work with functional programming and the latest ECMAScript features. Once you learn how to build React components with this hands-on guide, you’ll understand just how useful React can be in your organization. ",

Or implement a complex multistep user action without writing messy code? How do you test your code? Make it reusable? Wire it to a backend? Keep it easy to understand? The React Cookbook delivers answers fast. Many books teach you how to get started, understand the framework, or use a component library with React, but very few provide examples to help you solve particular problems. This easy-to-use cookbook includes the example code developers need to unravel the most common problems when using React, categorized by topic area and problem. You'll learn how to: Build a single-page application in React using a rich UI Create progressive web applications that users can install and work with offline Integrate with backend services such as REST and GraphQL Automatically test for accessibility problems in your application Secure applications with fingerprints and security tokens using WebAuthn Deal with bugs and avoid common functional and performance problems",

			"Chapter 12. Server Side Rendering Server side rendering is vital if you want search engines to crawl your site. It also provides a performance boost as the browser can start displaying your site while your javascript is still loading. The virtual DOM in React.js is central to why React.js can be used for server side rendering. Each React.js component is first rendered to the virtual DOM, then React.js takes the virtual DOM and updates the real DOM with any changes. The virtual DOM, being an in memory representation of the DOM is what allows React.js to work in non browser environments like nodejs. Instead of updating the real DOM, React.js can generate a string from the virtual DOM. ",
