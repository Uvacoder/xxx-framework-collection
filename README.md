# Framework.dev

Framework.dev is a knowledge base for different frontend frameworks

## Structure

- `@framework/system` is the themeable design system which powers all framework.dev sites
- `@framework/react` is the code for the react.framework.dev site

## Running locally

First of all, `yarn install`

Then, `yarn dev` will run all servers. Dev servers for specific packages can be run with `yarn dev:<package-name>`
e.g. `yarn dev:system` or `yarn dev:react`.
